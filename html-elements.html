    <h2> Paragraphs </h2>

    <p>ALICE was beginning to get very tired ofsitting by her sister on the bank, and of havingnothing to do : once or
        twice she had peeped intothe book her sister was reading, but it had nopictures or conversations in it, “and
        what isthe use of a book,” thought Alice, “withoutpictures or conversations ?”</p>
    <p>So she was considering in her own mind,(as well as she could, for the hot day madeher feel very sleepy and
        stupid,) whether thepleasure of making a daisy-chain would beworth the trouble of getting up and pickingthe
        daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit withpink eyes ran close by her.</p>
  
    <p>There was nothing <em>so very</em> remarkable inthat ; nor did Alice think it so very much outof the way to hear the
        Rabbit say to itself,“Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be too late !”(when she thought it over afterwards, it
        oc-curred to her that she ought to have wonderedat this, but at the time it all seemed quitenatural) ; but when
        the Rabbit actually <em>took awatch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>,and looked atit, and then hurried on, Alice started
        to herfeet, for it flashed across her mind that she hadnever before seen a rabbit with either a
        waist-coat-pocket or a watch to take out of it, and,burning with curiosity, she ran across the fieldafter it,
        and was just in time to see it popdown a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>
    
    <p>In another moment down went Alice afterit, never once considering how in the worldshe was to get out again.</p>
